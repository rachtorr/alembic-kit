Hi! I am Rachel, recently became Dr. Torres. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with a mutli-institutional network working to develop earth and environmental data science curriculum with an Indigenous methods lens. I work in INRSEP+ at Cal-Poly Humboldt. My collaborators are part of the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/) and the [Geoscience Alliance](https://geosciencealliance.org/). 


#### Research Interests
Received PhD from UC Santa Barbara's [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/). I worked in the [Tague Lab](https://tagueteamlab.org/) and used the eco-hydrologic model [RHESSys](https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys). 

My dissertation research was in urban eco-hydrology; I am motivated to improve how we can efficiently use water resources and vegetation as green infrastructure to make cities more equitable and sustainable.
